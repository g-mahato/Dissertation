Project Overview

The study of earthquakes has become a prominent research area, driven by the challenge of identifying the crucial elements contributing to seismic events. The ability to predict earthquakes in advance is imperative for safeguarding lives and properties. However, this remains a significant challenge as no universally accepted method or technique for earthquake prediction has been established.
 
The prevailing technique involves analyzing historical earthquake data to identify patterns and make predictions about future events. Unfortunately, this method has limitations, providing only tentative information about the timing and location of potential earthquakes. To enhance the efficiency of earthquake prediction models, I propose expanding the dataset by introducing additional columns. These columns would capture relevant factors such as the gravitational forces of the Moon, the non-uniform gravitational field of the Earth.
 
By scrutinizing this enriched dataset, we aim to uncover the intricate relationships between various factors and earthquake occurrences. The influence of gravitational forces, both from the Moon and the Earth's varying gravity, along with the dynamic movements of tectonic plates, could significantly impact seismic events.
 
This research endeavor involves a comparative analysis of the results obtained from our enhanced dataset with those achieved using traditional methods and machine learning models for prediction. Through this comparative study, we seek to advance our understanding of the contributing factors to earthquakes and strive towards more accurate and efficient earthquake prediction models.
