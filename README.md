Abstract:

Earthquake prediction remains a critical yet challenging task in geophysics, with traditional methods often lacking precision. This study explores the potential of machine learning to enhance earthquake prediction by integrating geophysical and astronomical variables, such as the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon, their distance, and localized gravity variations. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2011 to 2024, collected from the US Geological Survey (USGS) and augmented through web scraping for additional parameters, various machine learning models were evaluated. The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the most effective model, achieving an R² score of approximately 0.299, with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.126 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2369. Significant predictive features were identified through Information Gain, ANOVA, and Lasso methods, indicating meaningful correlations with seismic activities. Despite the promising results, the moderate R² value suggests that additional factors and complexities are not fully captured by the current model. Future research should focus on integrating more diverse features, such as real-time seismic data, advanced geological metrics, and employing sophisticated machine learning techniques like convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Cross-regional studies are also necessary to validate model applicability across different seismic zones. This research underscores the potential of machine learning to improve earthquake prediction, advocating for continuous advancements in data integration and model sophistication.
